## Laser Designator Translation Sensor

Outputs relative translation of the ship to RX, RY, RZ. You can use this to do strafe arresting, emergncy stop, or gravity mitigation. 
It is also notably smaller/lighter than the required size CLF to do all speeds in all directions.

Currently requires a 30FPS frame limit and VSYNC off. We can make a 60/90/120 fps version with some sensor data from a stronger computer. 
Contact me if you'd like to put in the work.

Also requires calibration every time you move it in the designer. Move it around by 10000ths(you can enter values tha are below the decimal precision of the translation tool readout and have them work, but you still can't read that precision so remember what you entered) until SH and SV are zeroed when the designator is on.

Still very much WIP

## Laser Designator Translation Sensor
Outputs relative translation of the ship to RA and splits it into RX, RY, RZ. You can use this to do strafe arresting and maybe an inertial navigation system. 
It is also notably smaller/lighter than the required size CLF to do all speeds in all directions.

Currently requires a 30FPS frame limit and VSYNC off. We can make a 60/90/120 fps version with some sensor data from a stronger computer. 
Contact me if you'd like to put in the work.

Also requires calibration every time you move it in the designer. Move it around by 10000ths until SX and SY are zeroed when the designator is on.

Still very much WIP

These chips replace compassISAN3in and compassOutputXYZ with Fryke's IPS system and the "sacred grid" origin alignment. Reciver TM fields must be renamed FT, BT, and DT to use. These totally break :KS and have no speed calc of their own so you will have to deal with that.

I hate them and want to make a 2 chip version of IPS like compass SOONtm
